Hi! I am an aspiring game designer from Korea who wants to create a game that excites people. As a general designer, I want to make art crafted with engineering to pursue both visual aesthetics and fun.

I am currently graduating from [Kyung Hee University](https://www.khu.ac.kr/eng/user/main/view.do), [College of Art & Design](https://and.khu.ac.kr/and_eng/user/main/view.do), Department of Digital Content with a B.A. in [Digital Contents](http://dc.khu.ac.kr/html/)(2020.03 ~ 2025.02).

I can do:

* game design
* drawing
* product design
* video editing (Adobe Premiere)
* programming (C#, Unity)

I am currently working as a game designer with my friends on a horror-themed farming game for the [Farm Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/farm-jam-2025).
