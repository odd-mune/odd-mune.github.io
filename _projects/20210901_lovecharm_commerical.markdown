## Overview

üëú LOVE all your CHARMS, LOVECHARM!

I created a viral SNS advertisement video for the fashion brand ‚ÄòLoveCharm Îü¨Î∏åÏ∞∏‚Äô as part of the Kyung Hee University Industry-Academia Collaboration Design Marketing Support Team.

Produced a viral video that aligns with the brand image and can be used for promotional and SNS marketing purposes.
The video was designed with the MZ generation as the target audience, catering to their sensibilities.
Focused more on the fashionable and stylish aspects of the bags rather than emphasizing functionality, creating a hip and cool fashion video.
A short viral ad video of around 1 minute, perfect for Instagram feeds, reels, and YouTube, was planned to meet the company's requirements.
