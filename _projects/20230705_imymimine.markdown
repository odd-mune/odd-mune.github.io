## Overview

"An Invitation from a Parallel Universe"

This work offers an experience of encountering another version of oneself in a parallel universe that may exist beyond our own. We invite the audience into the IMYMIMINE universe, aiming to provide an interactive experience between the artwork and the viewers. As they explore the work, the audience can face various endings based on their choices.

The story was inspired by the film "Everything Everywhere All at Once" (2022).
