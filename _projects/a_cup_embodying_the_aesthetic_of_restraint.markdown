üç∂ "Enjoying the Aesthetic of Moderation"

Seonyubae is inspired by the Gyeongyeongbae, a cup crafted by Joseon-era potter Myeongok Woo.

In the past, Myeongok Woo squandered all his wealth due to his indulgence in alcohol. Overcome with regret and newfound wisdom, he devoted himself tirelessly to creating a single masterpiece. That masterpiece was the Gyeongyeongbae, a mystical cup designed to serve as a reminder to avoid excess. The liquid flows out when filled beyond approximately 70%, making it impossible to drink any further.

We have reinterpreted this historic cup modernly, bringing an entirely new product to life.

* Product Packaging Design
  * Including postcards, gifts, etc.
* Crowdfunding web design
* Product Photography and Editing

### Minor Contributions

* Customer services

### Major Challenges

* Inventory management
  * Due to the minimum amount of inventories required to request for manufacturing, we had some leftover products after distributing them to the patrons. We had to set the expected sales appropriately to determine the number of items to manufacture. We also had to open additional online store pages to sell the goods.
* Packaging design
  * I used eco-friendly design for the packages, and it was hard for me to find a good eco-friendly materials for especially the fillings
* Sending packages

### Possible Improvements

* Setting a leader role for more unified and focused viewpoints.
  * This project gave me a lot of insights into why a project needs a leader and what the leader should do for successful teamwork
