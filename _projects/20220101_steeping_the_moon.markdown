## Overview

Capturing the Uncontainable

I had an experience funding a modern reinterpretation of a traditional wine cup called Gyeongyeongbae on Tumblbug. During the initial product design process, I envisioned a design inspired by the shimmering moonlight and the glimmer of the ripples inside the cup. However, due to limitations in turning this concept into a tangible product, I had to abandon the initial draft. Driven by the realistic challenges that prevented this design from coming to life, I sought to bring it to fruition through media art.
